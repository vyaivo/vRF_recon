# vRF_recon
Code for estimating voxel RFs, IEMs (for stimulus reconstructions), and a simulated layered IEM analysis

This is the complete code base needed to reproduce analyses from the paper we published on biorxiv:
http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/10/086892.

The corresponding data will be available soon on Open Science Framework.
